    <h1>About Sheltered Homelessness</h1>
    <p>Sheltered Homelessness
        This organization has been founded by Rifumo Mabasa to help homeless people keep warm during this winter season by providing them with shelter and access to basic foods to help to maintain their health and ensure that there are fewer homeless people patrolling the streets to maintain a clean and healthy environment. Through this organization we plan to ensure that thereâ€™s less homelessness in the streets and to ensure that homeless people are provided with houses and shelter. This Organization is centered towards homeless people and the ensuring of their safety. 
        </p>
    
        <h1>Mission statement</h1>
        <p>With this Organization we determined to achieve a goal of developing a website that allows locals of the area to reach out and report any homeless people patrolling the area allowing us to help them get the proper care and shelter they need to keep warm, safe and allowing them access to foods and water in order to maintain their health. </p>
        <h1>Vision Statement</h1>
        <p>We plan on making this website attract more attention to the public by advertising this Organization to the people worldwide by posting billboards, TV commercials and making social media accounts to make it by the public eye</p>
        <h1>What we Do</h1>
        <p>At Sheltered Homelessness we specialise in providing safety and protection in local communities</p>
